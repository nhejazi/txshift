\title{Bound Generalized Propensity Score}
\usage{
bound_propensity(vals, bound = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{vals}{\code{numeric} vector of generalized propensity score estimates.
Note that the generalized propensity score is a (conditional) density and
should only be bounded/truncated away from zero.}

\item{bound}{\code{numeric} atomic giving the lower limit of the generalized
propensity score estimates to be tolerated. Estimates less than this will
be truncated to this value (default = 0.01). Note that the default may be
internally overwritten by reference to the sample size (n), so the lower
bound used is the greater of the specified value and 1/n.}
}
\value{
A \code{numeric} vector of the same length as \code{vals}, where the
 returned values are bounded such that the minimum is no lower than 1/n, for
 the sample size n.
}
\description{
Bound Generalized Propensity Score
}
\details{
Bound estimated values of the generalized propensity score (a
 conditional density) to avoid numerical instability issues arising from
 practical violations of the assumption of positivity.
