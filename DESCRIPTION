Description: Efficient estimation of the population-level causal effects of
    stochastic interventions on a continuous-valued exposure. Both one-step and
    targeted minimum loss estimators are implemented for a causal parameter
    defined as the counterfactual mean of an outcome of interest under a
    stochastic intervention that may depend on the natural value of the
    exposure (i.e., a modified treatment policy). To accommodate settings in
    which two-phase sampling is employed, procedures for making use of inverse
    probability of censoring weights are provided to facilitate construction of
    inefficient and efficient one-step and targeted minimum loss estimators.
    The causal parameter and its estimation were first described by Díaz and van
    der Laan (2013) <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01685.x>, while the multiply
    robust estimation procedure and its application to data arising in two-phase
    sampling designs was detailed in NS Hejazi, MJ van der Laan, HE Janes, PB
    Gilbert, and DC Benkeser (2020) <doi:10.1111/biom.13375>. Estimation of
    nuisance parameters may be enhanced through the Super Learner ensemble model
    in 'sl3', available for download from GitHub using
    'remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3")'.
