Description: Computation of targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimates of the
    population-level causal effect of a continuous-valued intervention based on
    a simple stochastic treatment assignment mechanism, defined as the
    counterfactual mean of the outcome of interest under an additive shift of
    the observed (natural) value of the intervention. To accommodate settings in
    which two-phase sampling is employed, an inverse probability of censoring
    weighted (IPCW) TML estimator for the counterfactual mean under the
    stochastic intervention is available, alongside procedures facilitating
    robust estimation of nuisance parameters in a manner ensuring nonparametric
    efficiency of the IPCW-TML estimator of the causal parameter.
