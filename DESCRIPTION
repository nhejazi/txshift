Description: Efficient estimation of the population-level causal effects of
    stochastic interventions on a continuous-valued treatment node. Both
    one-step and targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimators are implemented
    for a causal parameter defined as the counterfactual mean of the outcome of
    interest under a stochastic intervention that may depend on the natural
    value of the treatment (i.e., a modified treatment policy). To accommodate
    settings in which two-phase sampling is employed, procedures for making use
    of inverse probability of censoring (IPC) weights to build inefficient and
    efficient TML and one-step estimator variants of the population-level
    parameter are provided.
