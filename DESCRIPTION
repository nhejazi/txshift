Description: Facilities for computing targeted maximum likelihood estimates of
    population-level causal effects of continuous-valued interventions defined
    by stochastic assignment mechanisms. To handle applications with censored
    data (i.e., two-stage designs), an inverse probability of censoring weighted
    (IPCW) targeted maximum likelihood estimator for the stochastic treatment
    shift parameter is implemented as well.
