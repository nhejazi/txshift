> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Stochastic Interventions

**Authors:** [Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org) and [David
Benkeser](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#!dbenkes)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What’s `txshift`?

The `txshift` R package is designed to provide facilities for the
construction of efficient estimators of the counterfactual mean of an
outcome under stochastic interventions that depend on the natural value
of treatment (Dı́az and van der Laan 2012; Haneuse and Rotnitzky 2013).
`txshift`implements and builds upon a simplified algorithm for the
targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator of such a causal parameter,
originally proposed by Dı́az and van der Laan (2018), and makes use of
analogous machinery to compute an efficient one-step estimator (Pfanzagl
and Wefelmeyer 1985). `txshift` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) (Coyle, Hejazi, Malenica, et
al. 2022) to allow for ensemble machine learning to be leveraged in the
estimation procedure.

For many practical applications (e.g., vaccine efficacy trials),
observed data is often subject to a two-phase sampling mechanism (i.e.,
through the use of a two-stage design). In such cases, efficient
estimators (of both varieties) must be augmented to construct unbiased
estimates of the population-level causal parameter. Rose and van der
Laan (2011) first introduced an augmentation procedure that relies on
introducing inverse probability of censoring (IPC) weights directly to
an appropriate loss function or to the efficient influence function
estimating equation. `txshift` extends this approach to compute
IPC-weighted one-step and TML estimators of the counterfactual mean
outcome under a shift stochastic treatment regime. The package is
designed to implement the statistical methodology described in Hejazi et
al. (2020) and extensions thereof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=txshift) via

``` r
install.packages("txshift")
```

*Note:* If `txshift` is installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=txshift), the `sl3`, an
enhancing dependency that allows ensemble machine learning to be used
for nuisance parameter estimation, won’t be included. We highly
recommend additionally installing `sl3` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

``` r
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@master")
```

For the latest features, install the most recent *stable version* of
`txshift` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

``` r
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/txshift@master")
```

To contribute, install the *development version* of `txshift` from
GitHub via [`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

``` r
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/txshift@devel")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a
treatment, consider the following example:

``` r
library(txshift)
#> txshift v0.3.9: Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Stochastic
#> Interventions
```

``` r
library(sl3)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 500
W <- replicate(2, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5))
A <- rnorm(n_obs, mean = 2 * W, sd = 1)
Y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)))

# now, let's introduce a a two-stage sampling process
C_samp <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W + Y))

# fit the full-data TMLE (ignoring two-phase sampling)
tmle <- txshift(
  W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
  estimator = "tmle",
  g_exp_fit_args = list(
    fit_type = "sl",
    sl_learners_density = Lrnr_density_hse$new(Lrnr_hal9001$new())
  ),
  Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm", glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
)
tmle
#> Counterfactual Mean of Shifted Treatment
#> Intervention: Treatment + 0.5
#> txshift Estimator: tmle
#> Estimate: 0.7688
#> Std. Error: 0.0189
#> 95% CI: [0.7296, 0.8038]
```

``` r

# fit a full-data one-step estimator for comparison (again, no sampling)
os <- txshift(
  W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
  estimator = "onestep",
  g_exp_fit_args = list(
    fit_type = "sl",
    sl_learners_density = Lrnr_density_hse$new(Lrnr_hal9001$new())
  ),
  Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm", glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
)
os
#> Counterfactual Mean of Shifted Treatment
#> Intervention: Treatment + 0.5
#> txshift Estimator: onestep
#> Estimate: 0.7671
#> Std. Error: 0.0192
#> 95% CI: [0.7273, 0.8027]
```

``` r

# fit an IPCW-TMLE to account for the two-phase sampling process
tmle_ipcw <- txshift(
  W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5, C_samp = C_samp, V = c("W", "Y"),
  estimator = "tmle", max_iter = 5, eif_reg_type = "glm",
  samp_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm"),
  g_exp_fit_args = list(
    fit_type = "sl",
    sl_learners_density = Lrnr_density_hse$new(Lrnr_hal9001$new())
  ),
  Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm", glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
)
tmle_ipcw
#> Counterfactual Mean of Shifted Treatment
#> Intervention: Treatment + 0.5
#> txshift Estimator: tmle
#> Estimate: 0.76
#> Std. Error: 0.0205
#> 95% CI: [0.7176, 0.7978]
```

``` r

# compare with an IPCW-agumented one-step estimator under two-phase sampling
os_ipcw <- txshift(
  W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5, C_samp = C_samp, V = c("W", "Y"),
  estimator = "onestep", eif_reg_type = "glm",
  samp_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm"),
  g_exp_fit_args = list(
    fit_type = "sl",
    sl_learners_density = Lrnr_density_hse$new(Lrnr_hal9001$new())
  ),
  Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm", glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
)
os_ipcw
#> Counterfactual Mean of Shifted Treatment
#> Intervention: Treatment + 0.5
#> txshift Estimator: onestep
#> Estimate: 0.76
#> Std. Error: 0.0204
#> 95% CI: [0.7177, 0.7978]
