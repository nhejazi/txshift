> Targeted Learning of the Causal Effects of Stochastic Interventions

**Authors:** [Nima Hejazi](https://nimahejazi.org) and [David
Benkeser](https://www.benkeserstatistics.com/)

## What’s `txshift`?

The `txshift` R package is designed to provide facilities to compute
targeted maximum likelihood estimates (TMLE) of the population-level
causal effect of interventions based on stochastic mechanisms for
treatment assignment (Díaz and van der Laan (2012)). As opposed to the
original algorithm given for computing such a TMLE, `txshift` implements
and builds upon subsequent work by Díaz and van der Laan (2018), who
reveal a simplified algorithm for computing the TML estimator of the
shift intervention causal effect parameter.

For many practical applications (e.g., observational medical studies),
it is often the case that the data structure of interest is generated by
a selective sampling process (i.e., a two-stage design). In such cases,
TML estimators may be augmented to cope with – and even exhibit
efficiency – in spite of the challenges induced by such an artificial
censoring process. This augmentation procedure is done by way of adding
inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW), which leads to an
IPCW-TMLE, originally proposed by Rose and van der Laan (2011).
`txshift` extends the approach of computing IPCW-TMLEs to the shift
intervention causal effect parameter.

For background on the Targeted Learning methodology, as well as recent
advances, the canonical references are van der Laan and Rose (2011) and
van der Laan and Rose (2018).

## Installation

Install the most recent *stable release* from GitHub via
[`devtools`](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/devtools/):

``` r
devtools::install_github("nhejazi/txshift", build_vignettes = FALSE)
```

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a
treatment, consider the following example:

``` r
library(txshift)
library(condensier)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 1000  # number of observations
n_w <- 1  # number of baseline covariates
p_w <- 0.5  # probability of a success ("1") in the baseline variables
tx_mult <- 2  # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariate -- simple, binary
W <- as.numeric(replicate(n_w, rbinom(n_obs, 1, p_w)))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- as.numeric(rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1))

# create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)

# fit the TMLE
tmle_shift <- tmle_txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                           g_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                             nbins = 25,
                                             bin_method = "dhist",
                                             bin_estimator =
                                               speedglmR6$new(),
                                             parfit = FALSE),
                           Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm",
                                             glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
                          )

# now, let's introduce a censoring process (for two-stage sampling)
C <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W + Y))

# fit an IPCW-TMLE to account for this censoring process:
ipcwtmle_shift <- tmle_txshift(W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
                               C = C, V = c("W", "Y"),
                               max_iter = 10,  # limit iterations for speed
