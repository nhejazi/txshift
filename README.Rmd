> Efficient Estimation of the Causal Effects of Stochastic Interventions

## What's `txshift`?

The `txshift` R package is designed to provide facilities for the construction
of efficient estimators of the counterfactual mean of an outcome under
stochastic interventions that depend on the natural value of treatment
[@diaz2012population; @haneuse2013estimation]. `txshift `implements and builds
upon a simplified algorithm for the targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator
of such a causal parameter, originally proposed by @diaz2018stochastic, and
makes use of analogous machinery to compute an efficient one-step estimator
[@pfanzagl1985contributions]. `txshift` integrates with the [`sl3`
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle-sl3-rpkg] to allow for ensemble
machine learning to be leveraged in the estimation procedure.

For many practical applications (e.g., vaccine efficacy trials), observed data
is often subject to a two-phase sampling mechanism (i.e., through the use of a
two-stage design). In such cases, efficient estimators (of both varieties) must
be augmented to construct unbiased estimates of the population-level causal
parameter. @rose2011targeted2sd first introduced an augmentation procedure that
relies on introducing inverse probability of censoring (IPC) weights directly to
an appropriate loss function or to the efficient influence function estimating
equation. `txshift` extends this approach to compute IPC-weighted one-step and
TML estimators of the counterfactual mean outcome under a shift stochastic
treatment regime. The package is designed to implement the statistical
methodology described in @hejazi2020efficient and extensions thereof.

## Installation

For standard use, we recommend installing the package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=txshift) via

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("txshift")
```

_Note:_ If `txshift` is installed from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=txshift), the `sl3`, an enhancing
dependency that allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance
parameter estimation, won't be included. We highly recommend additionally
installing `sl3` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r sl3-gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@master")
```

For the latest features, install the most recent _stable version_  of `txshift`
from GitHub via [`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-master-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/txshift@master")
```

To contribute, install the _development version_ of `txshift` from GitHub via
[`remotes`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=remotes):

```{r gh-devel-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("nhejazi/txshift@devel")
```

## Example

To illustrate how `txshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a treatment,
consider the following example:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(txshift)
library(sl3)
set.seed(429153)

# simulate simple data
n_obs <- 500
W <- replicate(2, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5))
A <- rnorm(n_obs, mean = 2 * W, sd = 1)
Y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(A + W + rnorm(n_obs, mean = 0, sd = 1)))

# now, let's introduce a a two-stage sampling process
C_samp <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(W + Y))

# fit the full-data TMLE (ignoring two-phase sampling)
tmle <- txshift(
  W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
  estimator = "tmle",
  g_exp_fit_args = list(
    fit_type = "sl",
    sl_learners_density = Lrnr_density_hse$new(Lrnr_hal9001$new())
  ),
  Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm", glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
)
tmle

# fit a full-data one-step estimator for comparison (again, no sampling)
os <- txshift(
  W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5,
  estimator = "onestep",
  g_exp_fit_args = list(
    fit_type = "sl",
    sl_learners_density = Lrnr_density_hse$new(Lrnr_hal9001$new())
  ),
  Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm", glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
)
os

# fit an IPCW-TMLE to account for the two-phase sampling process
tmle_ipcw <- txshift(
  W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5, C_samp = C_samp, V = c("W", "Y"),
  estimator = "tmle", max_iter = 5, eif_reg_type = "glm",
  samp_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm"),
  g_exp_fit_args = list(
    fit_type = "sl",
    sl_learners_density = Lrnr_density_hse$new(Lrnr_hal9001$new())
  ),
  Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm", glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
)
tmle_ipcw

# compare with an IPCW-agumented one-step estimator under two-phase sampling
os_ipcw <- txshift(
  W = W, A = A, Y = Y, delta = 0.5, C_samp = C_samp, V = c("W", "Y"),
  estimator = "onestep", eif_reg_type = "glm",
  samp_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm"),
  g_exp_fit_args = list(
    fit_type = "sl",
    sl_learners_density = Lrnr_density_hse$new(Lrnr_hal9001$new())
  ),
  Q_fit_args = list(fit_type = "glm", glm_formula = "Y ~ .")
)
os_ipcw
```
